Hi 👋. I'm Eng. Mohmmad, a student learning Android development, persistent and results-oriented with some knowledge of Android app development and a passion for crafting high-quality apps and libraries. With my focus on quality and deep understanding of the Android ecosystem, I build solutions that are not only functional but also fun. In addition to my 7am-5pm work, I love giving back to the community by blogging, speaking, and bringing my ideas to market. If I wasn't crafting an app/library, I'd probably question the existence of the universe.
